# Digit-recognition-app-using-Neural-networks

## App Description
This app uses Artificial neural networks for identification of the numbers which are handwritten on the screen. Handwritten Digit Recognition is one of the most fundamental problems in designing practical
recognition system. Immediate applications of the digit recognition techniques include, address
code reading, vehicleâ€™s number plate and bank check processing etc


## OBJECTIVES
* To provide an easy user interface to draw numbers.
* System should provide accurate recognition of the drawn numbers.
* System should be able to pre-process the given input to suppress the background.
* System should recognize digit present in the image and display them to the user.


#### Dataset: [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)  
The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher
Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem.

## Implementation
The app is made using tensorflow artificial neural network model for the implementation of the recogniser which is then wrapped up is a functionality of an app.

## Use
The app can be used to teach maths to kids at a primary level.
